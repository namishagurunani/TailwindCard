# HTML (index.html):
- Document Structure:
- This HTML document starts with the usual document structure including a doctype declaration, 'html', 'head', and 'body' tags.
  Meta Tags:
- The 'meta' tags in the 'head' section set the character encoding and define the viewport for responsive design.
  Title:
- The 'title' tag sets the title of the web page to "Card-tailwind."
  Linking External CSS:
- The 'link' tag links an external CSS file named "style.css," which contains the custom styles for the webpage.
  Linking Tailwind CSS:
- The 'script' tag includes a link to the Tailwind CSS library from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), making the Tailwind CSS utility classes available for styling.
  Body Structure:
- Inside the <body>, there is a container 'div' with a set of Tailwind CSS classes:
- flex: Makes its child elements flexible for alignment.
- items-center: Centers items vertically.
- justify-center: Centers items horizontally.
- h-screen: Sets the container to the full height of the screen.
- font-sans: Sets the font to a sans-serif typeface.
- max-[768px]:p-6: Sets padding to 1.5rem (24px) when the screen width is less than or equal to 768px.
  Card Layout Structure:
- Within the container <div>, there's another 'div' that represents a card. It uses several Tailwind CSS classes to style the card, including rounded corners and drop shadows.
# CSS (style.css):
  Reset Styles:
- The CSS file starts with a section that resets default styles for various HTML elements. It aims to provide a consistent base styling.
  Custom Properties:
- Custom properties (CSS variables) are defined to potentially use with Tailwind CSS classes. These custom properties likely hold values that can be dynamically 
  applied to elements.
- Custom Properties for ::backdrop:
- Similar to the previous section, custom properties specific to the ::backdrop pseudo-element are defined. These may be used for styling backdrop elements in 
  certain situations.
